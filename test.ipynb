This, in turns, means spending less money on energy. Switching to a more fuel efficient vehicle makes financial sense because it will cost you less in gas.

Did we just have to get it to a certain point and now it will skyrocket?  I see posts on reddit every other week about some finding or another that says warming is happening even faster than previously thought.  \\n\\nSomething else that has me wondering:\\n\\nPeople talk about the methane being released by creatures trapped under what should be permafrost, which is now melting.  What was going on with the climate when it was warm enough for those creatures to be alive and thriving in their environments?\\n\\nI\\'m also not trying to say climate change and global warming aren\\'t happening, and that the results won\\'t be catastrophic, but I just wonder about the answers to some of these questions.',\n",
